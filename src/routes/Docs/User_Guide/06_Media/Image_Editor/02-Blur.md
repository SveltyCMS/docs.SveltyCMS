# Blur Tool User Guide

The Blur Tool allows you to selectively blur parts of your image. This is particularly useful for:
- Protecting sensitive information
- Creating depth-of-field effects
- Highlighting specific areas by blurring others
- Censoring or redacting content

## Getting Started

1. Select the Blur Tool from the toolbar
2. The cursor will change to a crosshair, indicating you're ready to select a region
3. Click and drag to create a blur region
4. Adjust the blur strength using the slider control

## Features

### Region Selection
- Click and drag to create a blur region
- The selected area will be marked with a dashed white border
- You can create multiple blur regions on the same image

### Blur Strength
- Use the slider to adjust the mosaic strength (1-20)
- Lower values create a subtle blur effect
- Higher values create a more pixelated, mosaic effect

### Region Manipulation
- Drag the region to reposition it
- Use the corner handles to resize
- Use the rotation handle to rotate
- Double-click to delete a region

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|---------|
| Esc | Cancel current selection |
| Delete | Remove selected region |
| Ctrl + Z | Undo last action |
| Ctrl + Y | Redo last action |

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Precise Selection**
   - Hold Shift while dragging to maintain aspect ratio
   - Use the corner handles for fine-tuned adjustments
   - Double-click outside to deselect all regions

2. **Optimal Blur Strength**
   - Start with a lower value (around 5) for subtle effects
   - Use higher values (15-20) for complete content obscuring
   - Preview the effect before applying

3. **Multiple Regions**
   - Create multiple regions with different blur strengths
   - Click to select different regions
   - Use Shift + Click to select multiple regions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blur Not Visible**
   - Ensure the blur strength is high enough
   - Check if the region is properly selected
   - Verify the region is within image bounds

2. **Region Selection Problems**
   - Clear selection and try again
   - Ensure you're clicking and dragging
   - Check if the tool is active

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce the number of blur regions
   - Lower the blur strength for better performance
   - Consider applying and merging regions

### Error Messages

| Message | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Cannot create region" | Ensure you're within image bounds |
| "Region too small" | Make a larger selection |
| "Maximum regions reached" | Merge or delete existing regions |

## Best Practices

1. **Content Protection**
   - Use higher blur strength (15-20) for sensitive information
   - Double-check the blur effect at full zoom
   - Consider saving a backup before applying

2. **Artistic Effects**
   - Use lower blur strength (3-8) for subtle effects
   - Combine with other tools for creative results
   - Experiment with different region shapes

3. **Performance**
   - Apply and merge regions when finished
   - Work with smaller regions for better responsiveness
   - Save your work regularly

## Examples

### Privacy Protection
1. Select the Blur Tool
2. Draw a region over sensitive information
3. Set blur strength to maximum (20)
4. Apply the effect

### Depth Effect
1. Select the Blur Tool
2. Create a region around background elements
3. Set a moderate blur strength (8-12)

## Connection Management

### Connecting to MariaDB
The `connect` method establishes a connection using a pool, which manages multiple database connections to improve performance and reliability.

```javascript
async connect(): Promise<void> {
    try {
        await this.pool.getConnection();
        console.log('Successfully connected to the MariaDB database');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Connection failed:', error.message);
        throw new Error('Failed to connect to MariaDB.');
    }
}

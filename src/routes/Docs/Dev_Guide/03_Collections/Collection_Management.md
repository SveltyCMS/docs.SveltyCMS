# Collection Management in SvelteCMS

Collections are a fundamental concept in SvelteCMS that allow you to structure and organize your content. This guide provides an overview of collection management and introduces the two main approaches for creating and managing collections.

## What are Collections?

Collections in SvelteCMS are structured content types that define how your content is organized, stored, and displayed. Each collection consists of:

- **Fields**: Individual pieces of data (text, numbers, dates, media, etc.)
- **Validation Rules**: Rules that ensure data integrity
- **Display Settings**: How the content is presented
- **Permissions**: Who can view and edit the content
- **Workflow States**: Content publication and review stages

## Key Features

### 1. Flexible Content Modeling

- Create any content structure
- Multiple field types available
- Custom field validation
- Computed fields
- Field groups and nesting

### 2. Rich Content Management

- Version control
- Content preview
- Multi-language support
- Media management
- Content relationships

### 3. API Integration

- REST API endpoints
- GraphQL support
- Custom endpoints
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting

### 4. Advanced Features

- Content workflows
- Scheduled publishing
- Content validation
- Custom widgets
- Field-level permissions

## Approaches to Collection Management

SvelteCMS offers two complementary approaches to creating and managing collections:

### 1. Code-First Collections

The code-first approach is ideal for developers who prefer:
- Version control for collection definitions
- TypeScript type safety
- Programmatic collection creation
- Integration with development workflows
- Automated testing

### 2. GUI-Based Collections

The GUI approach is perfect for:
- Content editors and non-developers
- Quick prototyping and iteration
- Visual structure organization
- Real-time preview of changes
- No coding required

## Best Practices

### 1. Planning Collections

- Define clear content models
- Consider content relationships
- Plan for scalability
- Document field purposes
- Consider validation needs

### 2. Field Organization

- Group related fields
- Use clear field labels
- Provide help text
- Consider field order
- Use appropriate field types

### 3. Performance

- Optimize field usage
- Configure indexes
- Use appropriate widgets
- Monitor API usage
- Cache when possible

### 4. Security

- Set appropriate permissions
- Validate input data
- Sanitize output
- Protect sensitive fields
- Monitor access logs

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Approach**
   - Review the code-first and GUI documentation
   - Select the approach that fits your needs
   - Consider using both for different collections

2. **Plan Your Structure**
   - Map out your content types
   - Define field requirements
   - Plan content relationships
   - Consider workflow needs

3. **Implement Collections**
   - Follow the guide for your chosen approach
   - Test thoroughly
   - Document your implementation
   - Train content editors
